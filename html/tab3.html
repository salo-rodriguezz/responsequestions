<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.
</p>
<div id="analysis2Plot1"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn1" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <p>
    In the graph it can be evidenced a decrease since in the first month
    (December) the energy expenditure was 142 and in the last month (April) the
    expenditure was 126 , this is also known as a negative linear correlation
  </p>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
    $$ y= (-270)(6)+(141.50)= -1478.5 $$
  <p>
   R= It is estimated that next month -147.5 Kwhs will be consumed
  </p>
    
    <li>
      A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
      remain stable the consumption of electric energy.
    </li>
  </p>
</ul>

<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis2Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <p>
    This graph shows an increase since it starts with 2 residents consuming
    69kWhs of energy and ends with 8 residents consuming 728kWhs of energy, this
    is also known as positive correlation
  </p>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
</li>
$$ y= (107.69)(200)+(-211.55)= 21326.45 $$
<p>
  R= 21326.45 Kwhs will be consumed 
</p>
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
    between these two variables.
  </li>
</ul>
