<h3>Electric Energy</h3>
<p>
  Is a form of energy that results from the presence and movement of charged particles, such as 
  electrons it can be harnessed and used to power electrical devices and systems. The unit of 
  measurement for electric energy is the kilowatt-hour (kWh).

<h3>Watt (physical unit)</h3/>
  <p>
  The Watt is the SI unit of power, named after James Watt the inventor of the steam engine.<br/>
  One Watt is defined as the rate  at which work is done when one ampere of electrical current<br/>
  flows through a potential difference of one volt. In other words,one Watt is equal to one joule<br/>
  of energy per second.The Watt is commonly used to express the power  of electrical devices,such as
  of electrical devices, such as light bulbs, motors, and heaters

  <h3>Scatter plot</h3/>      
<p>
A scatter plot is a type of graph used to display the relationship between two continuous variables.
 In a scatter plot, each data point is represented as a point on the graph with its x-
 coordinate being the value of one variable and this y-coordinate being the value of the other variable. The pattern of the points<br/>

<h3> Linear regression </h3/>
  <p>
      Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable  
      and one or more independent variables. It assumes that the relationship between the variables can be
      represented by a straight line, and seeks to find the equation of that line that best fits the observed 
      data. The equation can then be used to make predictions about  the value of the dependent variable for a 
      given value of the independent variable. Linear regression is widely used in various fields  including 
      economics, finance,social sciences, engineering, and natural sciences.<br/>

        <h3>Renewable energy</h3/>
<p>
    Renewable energy refers to energy that is derived from renewable natural resources,<br/>
    such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, and geothermal heat, that can be replenished over time. <br/>
    Unlike fossil fuels, which are finite and non-renewable, renewable energy sources can be <br/>
    harnessed and used without depleting them. Renewable energy is often considered as a clean<br/>
    and sustainable alternative to conventional energy sources because it produces little to no 
    greenhouse gas emissions or other harmful pollutants. examples of renewable energy technologies 
    of renewable energy technologies include solar photovoltaic systems, wind turbines, hydropower
    plants, and geothermal power plants.
