    <h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
    <p>This second part of the project must be done individual.
      For each plot, you must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your information is true.
    </p>
    <div id="analysis3Plot1"></div>
    <p id="analysis3Eqn1" style="text-align: center"></p>
    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
    <p>According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic displays that behavior in terms of:
      </p>
      <ul>
            <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
            <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
            <li>Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.</li>
            <li>A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or remain stable the consumption of electric energy.</li>
      </ul>
    <h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
    <div id="analysis3Plot2"></div>
    <p id="eanalysis3Eqn2" style="text-align: center"></p>
    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
    <p>According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic displays that behavior in terms of:
    </p>
    <ul>
         <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
         <p>
            With respect to the graph of residents and energy consumption, we can consider
            that the regression maintains a constant increase, since we can observe the energy 
            expenditure with respect to each of the residents and the consumption they generate, 
            i.e.,the greater the number of inhabitants, the higher the consumption rate.
         </p>
         <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
         <p>
         With regard to the relationship between colours, we can see that the grey dots 
         form the line, in this case the regression that is increasing ,but as for the location
         and the result of consumption is represented by the red colour, depending on the residents,
         the total amount of energy is shown together
         </p>
         <li>Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$ people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.</li>
         <p>
        $$ y=108.85(200)+(-203.37)  y=21566.63 $$
         </p>
         <li>A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation between these two variables.</li>
      </ul>
